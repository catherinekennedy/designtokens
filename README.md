# Designtokens

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.0.

* The main aim of this project is to integrate 
Figma design tokens with codebase and to integrate both bit.dev
and storybook for versioning and ui test

* Here the design token studio plugin was installed
in figma and integrated in GitHub
* After that the token transformer is used to
to transform the complex token into simple token
* Then the style dictionary is used to transform the
tokens into css variable.

* The bit.dev angular is installed and used here.
But the angular version is not proper and no proper documentation is
given which makes me to go only with storybook

* The advanyage of using bit would be version control which is not provided in storybook
And the npm package release
